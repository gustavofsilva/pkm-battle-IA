# React + Vite Pokemon Battle Game Frontend

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. This project is the frontend for a Pokemon battle game.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Running the Project

To run the frontend development server:

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd pokemon-battle
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    If you haven't already, install the necessary Node.js packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    This command will start the Vite development server, usually on `http://localhost:5173`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

**Note:** For full application functionality, the backend server must also be running. Please refer to the backend's README for instructions on how to start it (typically in the `pokemon-battle-backend` directory).
